## Animation System

### Global Animation Toggle

A shared `AnimationContext` was implemented across game-picker and HookHunt to provide:

1. **User Preference Persistence** - Animation settings saved to localStorage
2. **System Preference Respect** - Automatically respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
3. **Runtime Toggle** - Users can enable/disable animations at any time

```tsx
// Usage example
const { animationsEnabled, toggleAnimations } = useAnimations();

// Animation variants that respond to the toggle
const cardVariants = animationsEnabled
  ? { initial: { opacity: 0, y: 30 }, animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 } }
  : { initial: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }, animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 } };
```

## Design Consistency

### Color Theming

| App | Primary Gradient | Accent |
|-----|-----------------|--------|
| Hub | Indigo → Purple → Pink | Purple/Pink |
| BlameGame | Orange → Red → Pink | Orange |
| HookHunt | Blue → Purple → Pink | Blue/Purple |

### Typography
- **Headings**: Extrabold, tight tracking
- **Body**: Regular weight, relaxed line height
- **Accent**: Gradient text for emphasis

### Components
- **Cards**: Rounded-3xl, white with subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Gradient fills, rounded-2xl
- **Tags**: Rounded-full, game-specific colors

## Playwright Test Coverage

### E2E User Flow Tests

## Recommendations for Future Iterations
