# PWA Icon Creation

The following icon files need to be created for the PWA:

1. `pwa-icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `pwa-icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These files should be created based on the existing `pwa-icon-512x512.svg` file and placed in the `public` directory.

## Steps to Create Icons

1. Open the existing SVG file in an image editor (like Inkscape, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator)
2. Export as PNG in the required sizes (192x192 and 512x512)
3. Save the PNG files in the `public` directory with the correct filenames

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use the same visual design as the SVG icon
- Make sure the icons are clearly visible at their respective sizes
- Maintain consistent padding around the icon
- Use the same color scheme as the SVG icon

This will enable PWA installation on mobile devices and browsers that support PWAs.
